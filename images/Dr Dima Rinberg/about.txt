After receiving my Ph.D. in Physics from Weizmann Institute of Science, I switched to Neurobiology. My adventure in olfactory processing started with discovering dramatic differences between olfactory bulb dynamics in awake and anesthetized mice (Rinberg-2006). The work of my lab in Janelia Farm (2006-2012) led to establishing temporal limits of behavior and neural processing in the sense of smell. I joined NYU Medical School in 2012.
