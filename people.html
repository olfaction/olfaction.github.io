        <p>After receiving my Ph.D. in Physics from Weizmann Institute of Science, I switched to Neurobiology. My
            adventure in olfactory processing started with discovering dramatic differences between olfactory bulb
            dynamics in awake and anesthetized mice (Rinberg-2006). The work of my lab in Janelia Farm (2006-2012) led
            to establishing temporal limits of behavior and neural processing in the sense of smell. I joined NYU
            Medical School in 2012.</p>

            A fundamental problem in neuroscience is mapping the physical properties of a stimulus to perceptual
            characteristics. In vision, wavelength translates into color; in audition, frequency translates into pitch.
            By contrast, the mapping from chemical structure to olfactory percept is unknown. In other words, there is
            not a scientist or perfumer in the world who can view a novel molecular structure and predict how it will
            smell. My research goal is to develop a predictive model relating molecular structure and olfactory
            perception using a combined psychophysical and molecular approach.</p>

        <p>The goal of our research is to address a core problem in neurobiology — how is the brain wired to extract
            information from the environment and convert that information into action? Our laboratory seeks to answer
            this question by studying the mammalian olfactory system, which affords most animals the ability to detect
            and appropriately respond to crucial environmental cues. The central hypothesis of our laboratory is that
            the neural circuits recruited by ethologically-relevant odors (such as those from food, predators and mates)
            are anatomically and genetically stereotyped; we leverage the invariance of this specific type of neural
            circuit to understand how odor inputs are detected in the sensory periphery, encoded by patterns of
            coordinated activity in the brain, and then decoded to generate meaningful patterns of action.</p>

        <p>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</p>
        <p>Alexei Koulakov and colleagues are trying to determine the mathematical rules by which the brain assembles
            itself, with particular focus on the formation of sensory circuits such as those involved in visual
            perception and olfaction. The visual system of the mouse was chosen for study in part because its
            components, in neuroanatomical terms, are well understood. What is not known is how projections are
            generated that lead from the eye through the thalamus and into the visual cortex, how an individual’s
            experience influences the configuration of the network, and what parameters for the process are set by
            genetic factors. Even less is known about the assembly of the neural net within the mouse olfactory system,
            which, in the end, enables the individual to distinguish one smell from another with astonishing specificity
            and to remember such distinctions over time. These are among the challenges that engage Koulakov and his
            team.</p>

        <p>Molecular recognition underlies all biological processes. A fundamental question in biology is how systems,
            from individual proteins to organisms, recognize molecular structure. The vertebrate olfactory system is a
            remarkable molecular recognition device. Animals can detect odorous chemicals at extremely low
            concentrations, and can discriminate among an enormous number of structurally diverse molecules. The
            long-term goal of our work is to understand how the nervous system encodes molecular information, and how
            neural circuits give rise to learned and innate olfactory-driven behaviors.</p>
