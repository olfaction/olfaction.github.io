            <p>
                The complexity of the mammalian brain challenges our ability to explain it. My group applies methods
                from mathematics and theoretical physics to understand the brain. We are generating novel ideas about
                neural computation and brain development, including how neurons process information, how brain networks
                assemble during development, and how brain architecture evolved to facilitate its function.
            </p>
            <p><br>Alexei Koulakov and colleagues are trying to determine the mathematical rules by which the brain
                assembles itself, with particular focus on the formation of sensory circuits such as those involved in
                visual perception and olfaction. The visual system of the mouse was chosen for study in part because its
                components, in neuroanatomical terms, are well understood. What is not known is how projections are
                generated that lead from the eye through the thalamus and into the visual cortex, how an individualâ€™s
                experience influences the configuration of the network, and what parameters for the process are set by
                genetic factors. Even less is known about the assembly of the neural net within the mouse olfactory
                system, which, in the end, enables the individual to distinguish one smell from another with astonishing
                specificity and to remember such distinctions over time. These are among the challenges that engage
                Koulakov and his team.</p>
